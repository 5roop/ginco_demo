Using GInCo to train a simpletransformers model

In `demo.ipynb` we demonstrate how to load the GInCo dataset, train a `simpletransformers` model and evaluate it on test data. 

*Work in progress.* 

Ideas for improvement:
* Once the dataset is published: do we download it first and then use load it? Alternative: use pandas to read it directly from web.
* Add citation information, link to the paper, ...
* After proper dataset publication possibly prepare a HugginFace dataset.
